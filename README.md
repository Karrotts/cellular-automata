# Cellular Automata
Cellular Automata is the application of rules on a set of random data on a grid. In this example, I have used cellular automata to produce cave-like or island-like images by applying several rules to my data which indicate which cell should stay and which cells should be removed. After the rules are applied, several smoothing steps are applied to give the outer walls a smoother appearance.

There are many different application in which cellular automata can be used. You can find more information about cellular automata here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton)
